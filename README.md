### IMPORTANT
> 2/01/2023: REPO IS READ ONLY SINCE NOW

As for now this repo is read only sice the team of the site that was needed to make all this work contacted me ([issue #2](https://github.com/Bbalduzz/Nexploix/issues/2)) and changed a key feature in the new user authentication. I'm working on a new method but for now this script won't work.

  <p>Wouldn't be beautiful to save your favourite film on your local storage for free?</p>
</div>

###  ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Note
This script only finds and downloads films in italian language due to its nature. It relies on an italian streming site.
I may add in future a workaround for other languages, but if u have already a solution make a pull

## Feautures
- ***watch*** in a new clean tab a movie (useful for those who don't have a netflix account)
- ***download*** any film to your local storage just by pasting the movie url
    - **multiple resolution** supported (max 4k)
    - **languages** supported: _italian_
    
## How to use
1. *downlaod* the repo:
    - using git: `git clone https://github.com/Bbalduzz/Nexploix.git`
    - download the zip and extract it
2. install the needed libraries:
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    - manually intall all the libraries
3. run the script
    - `python3 / py ntfx.py`
4. copy the **netflix film url** and paste it
    - actually what is needed is just the netflix title id. A serie of `8 numebers` (such as `70213514`) that can be found in link after `watch` or `title`
    
## TODO
- add tvshows support (really easy, will do as soon as I can)
